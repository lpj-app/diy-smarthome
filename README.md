# DIY-smarthome
DIY Smarthome: Linux-based system with database, React Next.js app, and JavaScript API. Supports Arduino and ESP-32 sensors.

A comprehensive DIY guide for creating your very own smarthome system. Perfect for tech enthusiasts who enjoy a blend of DIY and ready-to-use solutions. This project features a database, a Linux host, and an API that facilitates communication between sensors and the database, as well as between a web application and the database. The web application is built with React Next.js, and the API is developed using JavaScript.

By following this documentation, you will be able to operate a self-built smarthome system with a local database and web application running on a Raspberry Pi. The sensors can be integrated using an Arduino, ESP-32, or similar IoT devices.
